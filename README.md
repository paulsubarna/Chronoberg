# Official Repository of ChronoBerg

We introduce \CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a variety of temporal annotations. We also introduce historically calibrated affective Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD)  lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation. With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models trained sequentially on \CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation pipelines, and positioning \CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of linguistic change and temporal generalization.\color{red} Disclaimer This repository and dataset includes language and display of samples that could be offensive to readers
